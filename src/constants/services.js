Experiencing leaks or having sudden urges to urinate can be embarrassing and disruptive. But you're not alone. Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common issue for many women, but it's treatable. At Synergy Physiotherapy Hospital and Rehabilitation Care, we offer a comprehensive program designed to help women regain control and live life with confidence.

Our team of understanding physiotherapists specializes in women's health. They'll conduct a thorough evaluation to identify the type and cause of your incontinence, such as stress incontinence (leaks with activity) or urge incontinence (sudden need to urinate). With this understanding, they'll create a personalized treatment plan that may include:


- **Pelvic Floor Muscle Training (PFMT):** Strengthening these muscles, often called Kegels, improves bladder control and reduces leaks.

- **Bladder Training Techniques:** Strategies to gradually lengthen the time between bathroom visits and manage urgency.

- **Lifestyle Modifications:** Identifying and addressing triggers like caffeine, alcohol, or constipation can significantly improve UI symptoms.

- **Biofeedback Therapy:** Real-time feedback on your pelvic floor muscle activity helps you perform exercises more effectively.

- **Electrical Stimulation (if applicable):** Gentle electrical stimulation can help retrain the bladder muscles.

# Beyond addressing leaks, we focus on preventing future occurrences. We'll educate you on:

- **Proper toileting habits:** Establishing a regular bathroom schedule and complete emptying of the bladder can significantly improve continence.

- **Healthy weight management:** Excess weight can put extra pressure on the bladder, so maintaining a healthy weight can be beneficial.

- **Pelvic floor care:** We'll provide guidance on exercises you can do at home to maintain pelvic floor strength for long-term continence.
